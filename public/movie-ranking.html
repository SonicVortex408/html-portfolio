<h1>The Best Movies According to Riya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
It's really moving to see the father-daughter bond evolve in the themes of space and time, crisis and evolution. The greatest sci-fi movie of all-time.

<h3>Kill Bill</h3>
<p>Beatrix kiddo is my favorite lady heros of hollywood. Uma Thurman nailed the Hattori Hanzo training. Loved all the gory fight scenes and watch her fight with cotton mouth wearing a kimono!</p>
<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>It's a bowl of warm chicken soup to my inner child. Love watching this movie not just because Po actually is such a good cook and makes some mout-watering noodle soup bowls but also because of Master Oogway's wise teachings, to watch Po believe in himself and that there is no secret ingredient, it's just you..</p>
